# Showdown HD Sprite Mod
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FullLifeGames/ShowdownHDSpriteMod.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FullLifeGames/ShowdownHDSpriteMod)

This project is a mod that replaces the default Showdown Sprites with HD Sprites from PkPara√≠so.

This project is in a **Beta** phase, so use it with the knowledge that it might break!

Any issue or merge request is appreciated.
