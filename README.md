# Showdown HD Sprite Mod
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FullLifeGames/ShowdownHDSpriteMod.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FullLifeGames/ShowdownHDSpriteMod)

This project is a mod that replaces the default Showdown Sprites with HD Sprites from PkParaíso.

This project is in a **Beta** phase, so use it with the knowledge that it might break!

Please **note**: This current state tries to get all images PkParaíso, since not all Pokémon are available as HD sprites, this also does not render every Pokémon in HD sprites.

Any issue or merge request is appreciated.
